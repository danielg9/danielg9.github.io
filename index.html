        <!--Write some words about yourself in the p tags-->
        <p>I am a Junior at Virginia Tech with a double major in English and Religion and Culture and a minor in Mathematics.  I chose English because I love to read and write, and I am passionate about classic novels.  I read every chance I get, and I want to use this degree to teach at the high school or collegiate level.  I am also a religious person, hence the Religion and Culture major, and I would like to use the knowledge I gain from this degree to help out in a church, possibly leading a youth group.

        <h2>My project</h2>
        <p>Disc golf is a sport that has flown under the radar for many years.  Not many people even know it exists, but there are disc golf courses all over the place, one of which is a ten minute drive away from Blacksburg.  Disc golf is an amazingly fun sport, but it is also a community of people with common interests, and it is a great way to get exercise while spending quality time competing with friends.  I have been playing disc golf for over a year in my free time, and it is a great way to unwind after a long day and enjoy nature.  The goal of my project is to raise awareness for the sport of disc golf, informing others about the basics, and how fun and rewarding disc golf can be as a hobby.  I particularly want to focus on students here in Blacksburg, and help build the Disc Golf Club that has just kickstarted this year.
